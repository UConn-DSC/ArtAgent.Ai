# ArtAgent.Ai

## Purpose
We are proud to introduce ArtAgent.Ai: the inaugural open-source project by UConn Data Science Club. ArtAgent.Ai is a cutting-edge tool meticulously crafted for Visual Artists, harnessing the power of machine learning to guide users towards the most engaging online communities for their work. By embracing data-driven decision-making, ArtAgent.Ai empowers users to discover their artistic niche, amplify their popularity, and ultimately cultivate a sustainable income through commissioned projects that stem from their heightened visibility.

## Background
During HackUConn 2023, a team from UConn Data Science Club consisting of Pranav Tavildar, Alex McLeod, Sai Akavaramu, Jeffrey Chen, and Ankith Nagabandi initiated the development of this project. The first version of ArtAgent.AI was conceptualized, developed, trained, and tested over a an intense period of 20 hours. The tool employs web scraping techniques to extract image files from the trending section of the most popular art subreddits. Additionally, it harnesses the capabilities of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to process inputs and intelligently recommend the subreddits with the most closely aligned content.

## Current Plans
- Expand our data sets and models
- Improve UX and functionality
- Collaborate with the UConn Artists to modify logic
